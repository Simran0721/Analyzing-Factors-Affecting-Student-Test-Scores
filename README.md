# Student Exam Scores

## Project Objective:
Identify factors influencing student test scores in Math, Reading, and Writing. Explore potential interactions between these factors and their impact on test scores.

## Data Set Used:
<a href="https://github.com/Simran0721/Analyzing-Factors-Affecting-Student-Test-Scores/blob/main/Expanded_data_with_more_features.csv">DataSet</a>

## Questions (KPIs):
- Gender: Females tend to outperform males in reading and writing.
- Ethnicity: Students from certain ethnic groups may have higher or lower average scores.
- Parental education: Higher parental education is generally associated with higher student scores.
- Test preparation: Participation in test prep courses can positively impact scores.
- Extracurricular activities: Sports participation may have a positive or neutral effect on scores.
- Family factors: Marital status and number of siblings can have some influence on scores.
- Interactions: Factors may interact, e.g., parental education might have a stronger effect for students in test prep courses.

## Process:
- Data Acquisition: Download the student exam scores dataset from Kaggle.
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for analysis. This may involve handling missing values, converting categorical variables, and checking for outliers.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the data to understand the distribution of test scores, identify potential relationships between factors and scores, and visualize key insights.
- Statistical Modeling: Use statistical methods like correlation analysis, regression analysis, and potentially interaction analysis to quantify the relationships between factors and test scores. This will help determine which factors have the most significant impact and if there are any interactions between them.
- Data Visualization: Create visualizations like charts and graphs to effectively communicate the findings from the data analysis.

## Project Outcome:
- Identify the key factors that have the most significant influence on student test scores in Math, Reading, and Writing.
- Understand how interactions between these factors can influence student performance.
- Gain insights that can inform educational practices and support student success.

## Final Conclusion:
This project will provide valuable insights into the factors that affect student test scores. The findings can be used by educators, policymakers, and parents to develop targeted interventions and strategies to improve student learning outcomes.
